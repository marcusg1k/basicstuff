basic chatbot implemented that talks back in the terminal
its running off the openai libraries
after we input the api key we have access to the credentials paid for when we use openai keys, it functions like asking a bot questions in terminal
further in the future we can add more implementations where more accurate responses are given and the most recent chatgpt can be utilized better throught the terminal
